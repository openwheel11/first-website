	<h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>
	<h2>Classics</h2>	
	First, there are the classic cars. Typically they are sports cars, but not always.<p>
		The top of the list have to be Ferraris. Here are some of my favorites:<p>
			<h3>1967 Ferrari 330 2+2</h3>

I purchased one of these after college and restored it. Boy was it a learning experience. Good thing I had access to a machine shop and a friend who was a very talented machinist and mechanic. Parts were difficult to impossible to come by; we ended up making many of the parts ourselves.<p>
	<h3>1970's Ferrari 308 GTB</h3>

		This is the classic 308 GTB, made famous by the TV Show "Magnum PI" Note that it is the "European Model" which I beleive is much better looking than the US model.

	<h2>Off Road 4x4 Trucks</h2>
	Next up are the 4x4's. I have many happy memories of off-roading with my family, camping in the desert and exploring the wilderness. One of the first SUV's (before that was even a term) was this one: <p>
		<h3>1972 Chevy Blazer</h3>
